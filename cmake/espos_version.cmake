# Work out what version this build is, and put it where IDF will use it.
#
# version.txt alone answers "which release is this meant to be", which is not
# the question anyone asks of a device in the field. That question is "which
# build is on it", and between two releases every build answers `0.6.0` — the
# firmware on the bench and the firmware from three weeks ago are
# indistinguishable in `GET /api/v1/system/info`, in the OTA status and in the
# log banner.
#
# So: `git describe` when the checkout has tags, version.txt when it has not
# (a tarball, or a repo whose release has not been tagged yet). That is also
# the shape docs/rest-api.md has always documented — "0.1.0-3-gabc1234".
#
# Include before project(); IDF honours a PROJECT_VER set beforehand.

# ESP-IDF version policy, enforced by _espos_check_idf_version() in
# espos_project.cmake. .idf-version is the exact release CI builds and the
# docs say to install; it is the only one that is known to work. Any other
# release in [ESPOS_IDF_MIN, ESPOS_IDF_MAX_EXCL) is the same major.minor the
# components are written against, so it builds -- with a single warning that
# names the tested release, because a problem reported from such a build has
# to say so. Outside the range is a hard stop: another minor moves component
# APIs (esp_hosted, the TWAI driver, the linux target) under the code, and
# -DESPOS_ALLOW_IDF_MISMATCH=1 is the deliberate way past it, not a habit.
# Bump ESPOS_IDF_MAX_EXCL together with the pin, never ahead of it.
