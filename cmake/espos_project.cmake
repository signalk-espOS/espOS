# Shared project prologue/epilogue for firmwares built on espOS.
#
# Every espOS firmware needs the same things before `project()`: the supported
# IDF version enforced, espOS's sdkconfig defaults and partition table on
# SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS, espOS's components on EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS, an
# app-signing key, and the re-link-on-key-change workaround below. That was
# ~55 lines of CMake plus a copy of sdkconfig.defaults in each project root,
# which is exactly the code that must not drift: when the signing half of it
# goes wrong the symptom is a device that flashes fine over USB and then
# rejects every OTA, and when the sdkconfig half drifts a P4 consumer gets the
# SDIO block-ack window IDF picks for it and its WiFi wedges under load.
#
# Usage in a project's root CMakeLists.txt:
#
#     cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.22)
#     include("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/espos/cmake/espos_project.cmake")
#     espos_project_prologue(NAME "ble-gateway"
#                            PARTITIONS "${ESPOS_DIR}/partitions/16mb.csv")
#     project(ble_gateway)
#     espos_project_ui_partition()
#
# espOS itself includes it as `cmake/espos_project.cmake` — same code path, so
# the shared prologue is exercised by espOS's own CI on every target.
#
# This file includes ESP-IDF's project.cmake itself; do not include both.
