// The page list, and the hook a firmware uses to add to it.
//
// espOS's C side has a registration point for everything a firmware extends:
// espos_httpd_register() for endpoints, espos_config_add_descriptor() for
// settings. The UI had none — its routes were a const array in app.tsx — so a
// firmware that wanted a page of its own had to fork the SPA, and every
// espOS device shipped exactly the same six tabs whether or not the
// components behind them were in the build.
//
// A page can also say whether it belongs on *this* device: `available()` is
// awaited once at startup, and the tab appears only if it resolves true. That
// is how the BLE page shows up on a gateway and stays out of the way on a
// board with no Bluetooth, without the firmware having to declare anything.
