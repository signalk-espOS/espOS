 * SignalK access-token state machine — pure C. Drives the access-request
 * flow of the SignalK security API:
 *
 *   IDLE ──POST /signalk/v1/access/requests──▶ REQUESTED (poll href, backoff 5 s → 60 s)
 *          ├─ 404 security disabled ─────────▶ OPEN (no token needed)
 *          └─ 403 device requests disabled ──▶ DENIED
 *   REQUESTED ─ COMPLETED/APPROVED ▶ store token ▶ VERIFYING ▶ APPROVED
 *             ─ COMPLETED/DENIED   ▶ DENIED (no auto retry)
 *             ─ href gone (404/500 not found) ▶ IDLE (re-request)
 *   APPROVED  ─ periodic GET /signalk/v1/api/self with the token
 *             ─ 401/403 ▶ token invalidated ▶ IDLE
 *   VERIFYING ─ 200 ▶ APPROVED (self URN learned)   ─ 401/403 ▶ IDLE
 *   any leg   ─ the server's certificate is not the trusted one ▶ CERT_ERROR
 *               (token kept, flat 60 s retry, stream held down)
 *
 * Two rules that are not obvious from the diagram:
 *   - over plaintext a single 401 does NOT clear the token (anything on the
 *     path can answer one); two consecutive unauthorised answers do. Over TLS
 *     one is conclusive. See plain_unauth_streak below.
 *   - a TLS server skips the VERIFYING leg after an approval: the WebSocket
 *     upgrade carries the same token and rejects it just as clearly, so the
 *     leg would only buy a second handshake per reconnect.
 *
 * The machine never touches storage or HTTP itself: it asks the port to
 * do things (start a request, poll, verify, save/clear) and is fed the
 * outcomes as events. It runs unchanged on the host under test.
