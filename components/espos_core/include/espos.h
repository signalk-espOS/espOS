 * espos — one call brings espOS up.
 *
 *     #include "espos.h"
 *     void app_main(void) { ESP_ERROR_CHECK(espos_start(NULL)); ... }
 *
 * espos_start() runs the component starts in the one order that works
 * (docs/concepts.md): the log ring first so the boot log is kept for
 * /api/v1/logs; the config store next because everything else reads it;
 * the HTTP server before the network seam (espos_net) so /net/status and
 * the provisioning portal have a page to serve the moment there is a link
 * or an access point; espos_net before WiFi because it owns the hostname
 * the station's DHCP request carries and the mDNS responder; WiFi before
 * SignalK because discovery is mDNS; then OTA and BLE, which need all of
 * the above. Each espos_*_start() checks its own prerequisites and fails
 * with ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE when called out of order — espos_start() is
 * how an application never sees that error.
 *
 * Optional components (espos_sk, espos_ota, espos_ble) are started only
 * when the project builds them. That is decided at configure time from the
 * component list, not by the application. espos_wifi is built wherever the
 * chip has a radio (or, ESP32-P4, a co-processor) and left out on the
 * 802.15.4-only H-series; CONFIG_ESPOS_WIFI (default y) is the switch for a
 * firmware that links it but does not want the station started.
 *
 * Threading: call once, from app_main() or any task. The calls block until
 * every component has started its own tasks, then return; before_network
 * runs on the caller's task. Thread-safe against a second caller.
