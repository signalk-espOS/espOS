# espos_project_ui_partition() lives here rather than in the prologue because
# espos_httpd owns both ends of the web UI: src/static.c mounts the "storage"
# partition and serves what this function packs into it, and embeds the
# placeholder page shown when that partition has no index.html.
#
# It also makes the function reachable WITHOUT the prologue. A firmware that
# consumes espOS from the component registry never includes
# cmake/espos_project.cmake -- that file is not in the published archives and
# cannot be, since the prologue must run before project() and a component's
# project_include.cmake runs after. The bundle itself ships in this component
# (ui-dist/), which is the same rule the rest of the repo already follows:
# anything a component needs at build time lives inside the component.
#
# Included by the IDF build system after sdkconfig is generated and before any
# component CMakeLists.txt runs. Defining a function here is safe at that
# point; CALLING littlefs_create_partition_image is not, which is why the
# function is called from the consumer's CMakeLists.txt after project().

#
# espos_project_ui_partition([PARTITION <name>] [DIR <dir>] [NAME <label>])
#
# Pack the espOS web UI into a LittleFS image flashed with `idf.py flash`.
# Call AFTER project() -- littlefs_create_partition_image comes from the
# managed component. Default DIR is the bundle committed in this component, so
# a firmware build never needs Node; `npm run build` in <espos>/ui regenerates
# it when the UI changes, and CI fails if the commit forgot to.
#
# Captured at include time. Inside the function CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR is the
# CALLER's directory (the consumer's project root), not this file's, because
# the function body is evaluated where it is called.
