 * through espos_httpd_register(); the UI bundle is served from /.
 *
 * Every registered endpoint is protected by the REST authentication
 * (docs/security.md) unless registered with ESPOS_HTTPD_PUBLIC: when
 * httpd.api_key is set, a request must carry `Authorization: Bearer <key>`

 *
 * URI handlers run on the esp_http_server task — one task for every request
 * the device gets: build the reply, send it, return.
 *
 * API contract: docs/rest-api.md. Changing it is a cross-component decision.
