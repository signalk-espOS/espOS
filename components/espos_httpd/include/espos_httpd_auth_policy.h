 * REST authentication policy — pure C. Decides whether one request may reach
 * a protected endpoint, keeps the login sessions and throttles failed keys:
 *
 *   portal, no key set ──────────────────▶ allowed (this is where the first key is set)
 *   portal, key set, recovery window ────▶ allowed (physical presence was proved)
 *   portal, key set, no window ──────────▶ judged like any other request, below
 *   no key configured ───────────────────▶ allowed, or 403 when the build requires a key
 *   Authorization: Bearer <key> ─ match ─▶ allowed        ─ miss ─▶ 401 (counted)
 *   Cookie: espos_sid=<id> ─ live session ▶ allowed; a state change also needs
 *                                          Origin (or Referer) host == Host, else 403
 *   nothing ─────────────────────────────▶ 401
 *   ESPOS_HTTPD_AUTH_FAIL_MAX misses within ESPOS_HTTPD_AUTH_FAIL_WINDOW_S
 *                                        ▶ every key check answers 429 for ESPOS_HTTPD_AUTH_LOCKOUT_S
 *
 * The soft-AP network is NOT exempt once a key is set. It used to be, on the
 * reasoning that whoever joined the device's own access point was standing
 * next to it; that does not hold, because the access point is open by default
 * (wifi.portal_psk) and espos_wifi raises it unattended -- permanently when no
 * station network is configured, which is the normal setup for an
 * Ethernet-only device, and after wifi.portal_after_s otherwise. So anyone
 * within radio range was an operator (espOS #154). What proves presence now is
 * a recovery window, opened by espos_httpd_auth_recovery_open() -- on a device
 * from a run of power cycles, which nobody outside the room can produce.
 *
 * Key and session-id comparisons run in constant time over the maximum
 * length, so neither the bytes nor the length of a secret shows in the
 * response time. The machine never reads a header or a clock itself: the
 * caller hands it the parsed request and a port with the clock and the
 * entropy source, so it runs unchanged on the host under test
 * (test/host/espos_httpd_auth_test). espos_httpd owns the one instance a
 * device runs and serialises every call with its own lock; nothing here is
 * thread-safe on its own.
