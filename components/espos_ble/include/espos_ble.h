 * espos_ble — BLE gateway: bridges BLE devices to signalk-server's BLE
 * provider API.
 *
 * The device is a dumb, stateless bridge. It does NOT decode sensors and does
 * NOT publish SignalK deltas: raw advertisements and GATT bytes go to the
 * server, and signalk-server (with bt-sensors-plugin-sk) owns all decoding,
 * path naming and units. What each device is, which characteristics to read
 * and what to write arrives at runtime as `gatt_subscribe` commands.
 *
 * Two channels, both authenticated with the token espos_sk already holds:
 *
 *   POST /signalk/v2/api/ble/gateway/advertisements
 *        Batched advertisements, sent periodically.
 *   WS   /signalk/v2/api/ble/gateway/ws   (Authorization: Bearer <jwt>)
 *        Control protocol: hello/status out, gatt_* commands in.
 *
 * Needs espos_config, espos_httpd and espos_sk started first.

/** Reserve the radio controller's memory, before anything else takes it.
 *
 * Optional: espos_ble_start() calls this itself if it has not run. It exists
 * because WHEN the controller is initialised decides whether it can be at all.
 * esp_bt_controller_init() needs ~24 KB in ONE contiguous block, and it takes
 * it from the same internal heap the WiFi driver uses. Measured on an
 * ESP32-C5 (199 KB internal, single core, espOS #127): with the station up
 * first there are 33 KB free but the largest block is 16 KB, so the
 * controller cannot start however much total memory is spare -- and no amount
 * of freeing total heap fixes it, which is why capping WiFi buffers (~40 KB)
 * and trimming Bluedroid (64 KB of image) both failed to.
 *
 * Call it before starting a WiFi station on a part where internal RAM is
 * tight. On parts with room, or where the controller is a co-processor
 * (ESP32-P4), the order does not matter and this is a no-op beyond bringing
 * the stack up sooner.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT allocate the advertisement ring or start scanning.
 * The ring sizes itself from the largest free block, and run this early it
 * measures a heap nothing has taken yet and reserves far too much: 224 entries
 * (28 KB) on the C5, after which esp_wifi_init() got 1 of the 10 rx buffers it
 * wanted and the device reboot-looped. The ring belongs with the rest of the
 * gateway, after the network.
 *
 * espos_start() deliberately does NOT call this, and that is the honest state
 * of espOS #127 rather than an oversight. Reserving first does let the
 * controller start on a C5 -- measured -- but the memory has to come from
 * somewhere, and on that part it came from espos_sk_start(), which then failed
 * ESP_ERR_NO_MEM and, being a fatal stage, reboot-looped the device. Trading a
 * gateway with no BLE for a gateway that does not boot is not a fix. On a C5
 * the real answer is the 8 MB PSRAM die the module has and the build never
 * enabled (CONFIG_SPIRAM), which is a bootloader-level change and so a USB
 * flash rather than an OTA. Until a caller knows its own budget, this stays
 * opt-in. */

 *
 * It is also not merely a courtesy. Bluedroid keeps exactly ONE GAP callback
 * and registering is a setter, so a component like protocomm's simple_ble
 * silently takes ours when it starts -- after which scan results stop
 * arriving with no error reported anywhere. Suspending makes that explicit
 * instead of leaving a scanner that appears to run and receives nothing.
 *
 * Suspensions are COUNTED, so callers must pair them: scanning restarts only
 * when the last holder resumes. A firmware that adds a second holder -- BLE
 * provisioning is the obvious one -- overlaps the portal exactly on an
 * unconfigured device, and a plain flag there let one hand the radio back
