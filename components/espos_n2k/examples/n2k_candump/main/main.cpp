 * n2k_candump — an NMEA 2000 gateway: CAN frames off the boat's bus, out over
 * TCP in candump ASCII, which signalk-server reads with canboatjs.
 *
 * The device decodes nothing. It is a wire, and that is the point: PGN
 * decoding changes far more often than firmware should, so canboat owns it on
 * the server and this stays a pipe. Add the device in signalk-server as an
 * "NMEA 2000 IP gateway" with format `candump3`, pointing at this device's
 * address on port 2233.
 *
 * WIRING IS THE PART THAT GOES WRONG. A CAN bus needs a transceiver — the
 * ESP32's TWAI peripheral is TTL and cannot drive a differential pair — and
 * it needs termination. On a boat the backbone is already terminated at both
 * ends, so a drop cable adds none. On a bench you need 120 Ohm at each end or
 * nothing will be received, which looks exactly like a software fault.
 *
 * GET /api/v1/n2k tells the two apart without a serial cable:
 *
 *   frames: 0, errors: 0        nothing is transmitting, or you are not
 *                               connected to the bus at all
 *   frames: 0, errors climbing  you are on the bus and cannot understand it:
 *                               wrong bitrate, or a broken pair
 *   frames climbing             it works
