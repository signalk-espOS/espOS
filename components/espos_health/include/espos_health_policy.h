 * espos_health policy — the device watchdog as a pure C state machine.
 *
 * One tick (every CONFIG_ESPOS_HEALTH_POLICY_TICK_S on a device) reads the
 * heap, raises or clears the built-in conditions — lowMemory from the heap,
 * taskStalled from the registry of watched tasks — then asks whether any
 * condition flagged ESPOS_HEALTH_F_REBOOT_ON_ALARM is in ALARM and counts
 * strikes: N consecutive such ticks write a reset record and restart. WARN
 * never restarts, an ALARM without the flag never restarts, and one clean tick
 * resets the count, so a condition that comes and goes never adds up.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the platform. Clock, heap, the condition table, the
 * record store and the restart are injected through espos_health_policy_port_t,
 * so the machine runs unchanged on the host under test — the same shape as
 * espos_wifi_sm and espos_sk_token_sm. espos_health_policy_start()
 * (espos_health.h) owns the one instance a device runs.
 *
 * Threading: the caller serialises init/tick/watch/unwatch (the singleton uses
 * its own lock); port callbacks run on the caller's task with whatever it
 * holds. espos_health_policy_kick() is deliberately lock-free — it only stamps
 * a slot — so it may run on any task at any rate.
