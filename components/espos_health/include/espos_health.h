 * espos_health — the device's own view of what is wrong with it.
 *
 * A component that notices a condition it cannot fix — a wake service that
 * went away, internal RAM running out, a bus that stopped answering — raises
 * it here with a short stable key. Something else decides what to do with it:
 * espos_sk turns conditions into SignalK notifications, and any application
 * may add a sink of its own (a red LED, a line on a display, a relay).
 *
 * This exists so that "report a problem" is not a reason to depend on the
 * SignalK stack. espos_voice used to call espos_sk_notify() directly for its
 * one notification, which made a voice satellite unbuildable without SignalK
 * and pointed the dependency graph the wrong way — an optional component
 * depending on another optional component for a core concern. Reporting is
 * the core concern; SignalK is one sink.
 *
 * Conditions are level-triggered and idempotent: report the same state and
 * message twice and sinks are called once, so a caller may re-report on every
 * poll of whatever it is watching. ESPOS_HEALTH_NORMAL clears a condition and
 * is delivered like any other change — it is what retires an alert a previous
 * boot raised.
 *
 * The policy half (docs/health.md) is the device watchdog: a 10 s tick that
 * raises the built-in conditions (lowMemory, taskStalled), counts strikes for
 * conditions flagged ESPOS_HEALTH_F_REBOOT_ON_ALARM and restarts after N of
 * them, leaving a record the next boot can read. Loss of WiFi is never a
 * reason to restart; see espos_core's netDown.
 *
 * Thread-safe. Sinks run on the reporting task with no lock held, so a sink
 * may report conditions of its own; it must not block for long.
