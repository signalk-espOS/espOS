// WyomingSatellite — a Wyoming-protocol voice satellite for an ESP32 board.
//
// It is a TCP SERVER on :10700 (CONFIG_ESPOS_VOICE_WYOMING_PORT). The
// orchestrator (signalk-wyoming, or Home Assistant) is the CLIENT and dials
// out to us, exactly as it does to a wyoming-satellite. On connect it sends
// `describe`; we answer `info`, then it sends `run-satellite` (active) or
// `pause-satellite` (output-only). It keeps the connection alive with `ping`
// (we `pong`).
//
// OUTPUT (the boat speaks): the orchestrator frames TTS as `audio-start` /
// `audio-chunk` / `audio-stop`; we play it through the AudioDriver and reply
// `played`.
//
// INPUT (the boat listens, push-to-talk): trigger_ptt() sends `run-pipeline`
// and streams the mic as `audio-start` / `audio-chunk` / `audio-stop`; the
// orchestrator endpoints the utterance, runs ASR, and returns a `transcript`,
// which stops our streaming and plays a done sound. The orchestrator publishes
// the text to SignalK's voice.command — the panel itself is a dumb mic pump.
//
// Single-client by design (a satellite mic is an open channel — one owner
// at a time, the security model wyoming relies on). A second connection is
// closed immediately.
//
// WAKE MODE (optional, config.wake_host set): a SECOND, OUTBOUND connection
// to a wake service (openWakeWord :10400). The satellite streams the mic to
// it continuously and, on `detection`, starts the same pipeline PTT does —
// hands-free. The mic has exactly ONE consumer at all times: the wake loop
// captures while idle and PAUSES itself for the duration of a pipeline
// stream (whether triggered by a detection or a PTT press), so run_mic() and
// the wake loop never call record_pcm() concurrently.
