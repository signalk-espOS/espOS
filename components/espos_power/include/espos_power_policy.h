 * espos_power policy — may a duty-cycling device go back to sleep now?
 *
 * Pure C over plain inputs, so every rule is a host test. The rules are few,
 * and each one exists because a device that is asleep almost all the time is
 * almost never reachable, so a mistake here does not show as a bug report but
 * as a device nobody can talk to any more:
 *
 *   - Never while the running image is unconfirmed. Every wake from deep sleep
 *     is a boot, and the bootloader marks an image that is still
 *     PENDING_VERIFY at boot as aborted. A device that slept before its update
 *     confirmed itself would roll that update back on the first wake.
 *   - Stay awake for a window after any boot that is not the cycle's own timer
 *     wake — power-on, an update's reboot, a crash. That is the way back in:
 *     the web UI and OTA are reachable, and cutting the power always reopens
 *     it.
 *   - A wake has a deadline. A network that never comes up, or a server that
 *     does not answer, must not keep a battery device awake until it is flat.
 *     An application hold does not beat the deadline for the same reason.
 *
 * Threading: none. Nothing here allocates, blocks or calls out.
