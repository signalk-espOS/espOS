 * Liveness watchdog for the esp_hosted co-processor link (e.g. ESP32-P4
 * host + ESP32-C6 radio over SDIO).
 *
 * The failure this exists for: the transport dies while the host keeps
 * believing WiFi is fine. The symptom is a flood of
 *
 *     rpc_core: Timeout waiting for Resp for [0x126](Req_WifiStaGetApInfo)
 *
 * and nothing else — the whole RPC channel is gone, so the host cannot
 * even ask whether it is connected. esp_hosted declares
 * ESP_HOSTED_EVENT_TRANSPORT_FAILURE for faults it detects itself (a
 * dropped SDIO read, an all-ones PKT_LEN), but a silently wedged link
 * produces no event at all: there is nothing to detect, only an absence.
 *
 * The co-processor heartbeat supplies that missing signal. It arrives
 * over the same RPC channel that dies, so its absence IS the fault
 * detector. Miss enough of them and the link is gone regardless of what
 * the WiFi state machine believes.
 *
 * Recovery is a deliberate esp_restart(), not a transport re-init: the
 * esp_hosted_deinit()/init() pair asserts instead of failing when it cannot
 * re-allocate its SDIO pool (recover() below, and docs/wifi.md, "Why a
 * restart and not a transport re-init"). Detection is the valuable half: a
 * device that restarts 60 s after its link dies beats one that sits
 * unreachable until someone power-cycles it.
