 * espos_wifi — station connection manager with an explicit status model,
 * multi-network priority list, exponential backoff, static or DHCP
 * addressing, and a SoftAP provisioning portal. Configuration lives in the
 * "wifi" namespace of espos_config; status is exposed at GET /api/v1/wifi/status
 * and pushed on the SSE stream as "wifi" events.
 *
 * The station is one transport of espos_net (espos_net.h): it reports its
 * link there, and "is the network up" is espos_net_is_up(), not this
 * component's state — a firmware with an Ethernet port or without WiFi at
 * all answers the same question the same way. The device id, the hostname
 * (net.hostname) and the mDNS responder (espos_mdns.h) are espos_net's too;
 * the wrappers below stay for one release.
