"""Keep the consumer sdkconfig lint and sdkconfig.d/espos.defaults in step.

They are two expressions of one truth. The defaults file *provides* the
settings to a firmware that includes the prologue; the lint in
espos_core/project_include.cmake *demands* them from a firmware that does not
-- one installed from the component registry, where the prologue cannot
reach. A setting added to the defaults and not to the lint is invisible to
exactly the consumers who have no other way of learning about it.

Not every default has to be linted. Some are tuning a project may legitimately
choose differently; those are listed in COSMETIC below, with the reason. The
point of this check is that the choice is made deliberately rather than by
forgetting.
