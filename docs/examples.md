# Examples

Every example is a complete ESP-IDF project of its own under
`components/<component>/examples/<name>/`, built the same way as any firmware
on espOS: it includes `cmake/espos_project.cmake`, calls
`espos_project_prologue()` and `espos_project_ui_partition()`, and its
`main.c` boots with `espos_start()`. What each one adds on top is the point
of the example and fits in about a hundred lines. Each README says what the
example does, what it needs wired, what appears in Signal K, and — for
readers coming from SensESP — which SensESP example it replaces, and carries
a label: **Essential** (read these first), **Newbie** (one concept, no
surprises) or **Advanced**.

The index in the repository is
[`examples/README.md`](https://github.com/signalk-espOS/espOS/blob/main/examples/README.md);
the table below is the same list with the page it pairs with on this site.

## Build any of them

```sh
cd components/espos_sk/examples/analog_input     # or any other example directory
idf.py set-target esp32c6                        # esp32 / esp32s3 / esp32c3 / esp32c6 / esp32c5 / esp32p4
idf.py build flash monitor
```

Every example builds for `esp32c6`; the ones that drive a peripheral also
build for `esp32p4`, with the pins as `#define`s at the top of `main.c`. On
a small or shared machine use the locked wrapper instead of a bare build:
`/path/to/espOS/scripts/build.sh build` from inside the example directory
([Development](development.md)). The first configure generates a
*development* signing key with a warning; that is expected
([OTA → Signing key](ota.md#signing-key)).

`from_registry` is the exception, deliberately: it has no prologue, so nothing
generates a key for it and the build stops until you run
`espsecure generate-signing-key --version 2 --scheme rsa3072 secure_boot_signing_key.pem`
once, BEFORE the first configure. A key
invented by a build step is a key nobody kept, and a registry consumer's
project is not espOS's to put one in — see
[its README](https://github.com/signalk-espOS/espOS/tree/main/components/espos_core/examples/from_registry).

## The examples

| Example | Component | What it shows | Read with |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`minimal`](https://github.com/signalk-espOS/espOS/tree/main/components/espos_core/examples/minimal) | `espos_core` | **Essential.** The whole of an espOS application: `espos_start(NULL)`, then `environment.inside.temperature` once a second, a constant (293.65 K) standing in for the sensor. No wiring. Replaces SensESP's `minimal_app` and `constant_sensor`. The [getting started](getting-started.md) target. | [Concepts](concepts.md) |
| [`from_registry`](https://github.com/signalk-espOS/espOS/tree/main/components/espos_core/examples/from_registry) | `espos_core` | **Essential.** The same application as `minimal`, built the way a project outside this repository builds it: espOS from the component registry, a plain IDF root `CMakeLists.txt`, its own partition table and sdkconfig. Start your own firmware from this one. | [Releasing](releasing.md) |
| [`two_phase_boot`](https://github.com/signalk-espOS/espOS/tree/main/components/espos_core/examples/two_phase_boot) | `espos_core` | **Advanced.** `espos_init()` and `espos_start_network()` instead of one call, with the application's own work between them, and the pattern for a blocking espOS call — a worker task fed through a queue. Replaces `freertos_tasks`. | [Concepts → espos_start()](concepts.md#espos_start-the-order-and-why), [Threading contracts](concepts.md#threading-contracts) |
| [`custom_settings`](https://github.com/signalk-espOS/espOS/tree/main/components/espos_config/examples/custom_settings) | `espos_config` | **Newbie.** An application's own settings: declared once in `main/config/app.json`, used through generated key constants, applied live from the web UI, carried across a renamed key by a migration. Replaces SensESP's `ConfigItem`. | [Configuration store](config.md), [Add a setting](tutorials/add-a-setting.md) |
| [`app_endpoint_and_page`](https://github.com/signalk-espOS/espOS/tree/main/components/espos_httpd/examples/app_endpoint_and_page) | `espos_httpd` | **Advanced.** A firmware's own REST endpoints on the espOS server, a live value on the SSE stream the web UI already listens to, and a page of your own in that UI. Replaces SensESP's frontend plugins. | [REST API](rest-api.md), [Web UI](ui.md), [An app endpoint and a UI tab](tutorials/app-endpoint-and-ui-tab.md) |
| [`health_and_led`](https://github.com/signalk-espOS/espOS/tree/main/components/espos_health/examples/health_and_led) | `espos_health` | **Newbie.** A status LED driven from the device's health table, and an application condition the watchdog policy acts on — and what it never restarts for. Replaces SensESP's `SystemStatusLed`. | [Device health](health.md) |
| [`analog_input`](https://github.com/signalk-espOS/espOS/tree/main/components/espos_sk/examples/analog_input) | `espos_sk` | **Essential.** One ADC pin read every second — factory-calibrated, averaged, scaled by two settings from the web UI — published to a Signal K path: the shape of every "sensor on a wire" device. Replaces SensESP's `analog_input`, `repeat_sensor_analog_input` and its tank-level tutorial. | [Your first sensor](tutorials/first-sensor.md), [Tank level](tutorials/tank-level.md) |
| [`pulse_counter`](https://github.com/signalk-espOS/espOS/tree/main/components/espos_sk/examples/pulse_counter) | `espos_sk` | **Newbie.** Pulses on a GPIO counted by the PCNT peripheral with its glitch filter, published as revolutions per second, with a running total kept in the config store across reboots — engine RPM, shaft speed, chain or flow. Replaces `rpm_counter`, `pcnt_rpm_counter`, `chain_counter`, `time_counter`. | [Signal K → Delta stream](signalk.md#delta-stream-m4) |
| [`digital_switch`](https://github.com/signalk-espOS/espOS/tree/main/components/espos_sk/examples/digital_switch) | `espos_sk` | **Newbie.** A GPIO output whose state is a Signal K switch path, toggled by a debounced button; published on change and every 10 s so a late dashboard still shows the truth. Replaces SensESP's `smart_switch`. | [Signal K → Inbound](signalk.md#inbound-m7) |
| [`listener_relay`](https://github.com/signalk-espOS/espOS/tree/main/components/espos_sk/examples/listener_relay) | `espos_sk` | **Newbie.** A relay driven by a value the server streams: subscribe to `environment.outside.illuminance`, switch on below 50 lux and off above 100 (hysteresis), publish the relay's state back. Replaces SensESP's `listener`. | [Concepts → Threading contracts](concepts.md#threading-contracts) |
| [`json_and_meta`](https://github.com/signalk-espOS/espOS/tree/main/components/espos_sk/examples/json_and_meta) | `espos_sk` | **Advanced.** The three calls a plain number does not cover, framed as a windlass controller: `espos_sk_publish_json()` for an object, `espos_sk_declare_meta()` for a path only this device knows, `espos_sk_notify()` for a condition of the device. No hardware. Replaces `raw_json` and the `metadata` example. | [Signal K → Delta stream](signalk.md#delta-stream-m4), [Device health](health.md) |
| [`tls_server`](https://github.com/signalk-espOS/espOS/tree/main/components/espos_sk/examples/tls_server) | `espos_sk` | **Advanced.** The Signal K connection over https and wss: `CONFIG_ESPOS_SK_TLS` in the build, `sk.scheme` defaults to `auto` and `sk.tls_trust` to `tofu`, so a self-signed boat server is pinned on first use and works with no configuration | [Signal K → TLS](signalk.md#tls-https-wss), [Security](security.md) |
| [`sensor_graph`](https://github.com/signalk-espOS/espOS/tree/main/components/espos_flow/examples/sensor_graph) | `espos_flow` | **Newbie.** The whole of a sensor firmware as four lines of wiring, in C++: a poll, a calibration, a Signal K sink, connected with `>>`. The same device as `analog_input` above, which is not obsolete — the graph is sugar over exactly those calls. A fake reading keeps it about the wiring and lets it build for every target. | [Data flow](flow.md), [Migrating from SensESP](migration-from-sensesp.md) |
| [`dusk_relay`](https://github.com/signalk-espOS/espOS/tree/main/components/espos_sk_flow/examples/dusk_relay) | `espos_sk_flow` | **Newbie.** `listener_relay` as a graph: a value the server streams, through a hysteresis node, to a relay, published back. The queue and the worker task the C version needs are gone — `Listener` posts into a mailbox and the flow loop is the worker. | [Data flow](flow.md), [Transforms and formulas](transforms.md) |
| [`smart_switch`](https://github.com/signalk-espOS/espOS/tree/main/components/espos_sk_flow/examples/smart_switch) | `espos_sk_flow` | **Advanced.** A relay a phone can switch and a button that switches it back: the example that could not be written before inbound PUT existed. Shows why a device must publish a path before the server will route a PUT to it, and the difference between a spec path and one of your own. | [Signal K → Inbound PUT](signalk.md#inbound-put-control), [Sensors](sensors.md) |
| [`ble_gateway`](https://github.com/signalk-espOS/espOS/tree/main/components/espos_ble/examples/ble_gateway) | `espos_ble` | **Advanced.** A BLE-to-Signal K gateway, and a whole firmware in one call: advertisements batched to signalk-server's BLE provider API, GATT sessions driven by the server over a control WebSocket. The gateway decodes nothing — what a device *is* is decided by `bt-sensors-plugin-sk` on the server. Was the separate `espos-ble-gateway` repository until it became twenty lines; what is worth reading is its two sdkconfig fragments. | [BLE gateway](ble.md) |
| [`n2k_candump`](https://github.com/signalk-espOS/espOS/tree/main/components/espos_n2k/examples/n2k_candump) | `espos_n2k` | **Advanced.** An NMEA 2000 gateway: CAN frames off the bus, out over TCP as candump ASCII for canboatjs. Decodes nothing on the device — PGN decoding changes more often than firmware should. Read it for the wiring, which is what actually goes wrong: a transceiver and termination are not optional, and both fail looking exactly like a software fault. `GET /api/v1/n2k` tells a quiet bus from a misconfigured one. | [N2K gateway](n2k.md) |
| [`ethernet`](https://github.com/signalk-espOS/espOS/tree/main/components/espos_eth/examples/ethernet) | `espos_eth` | **Newbie.** An espOS device on a cable, for the Waveshare ESP32-P4 PoE board: the whole firmware is `espos_start()`, WiFi is off, and SignalK, OTA and the web UI run over wired Ethernet. Read it for the power caution — USB and PoE never at once — and for checking the route over the network, since the serial console is out of reach once the board is on PoE. | [Network](net.md) |
| [`ble_provisioning`](https://github.com/signalk-espOS/espOS/tree/main/components/espos_prov/examples/ble_provisioning) | `espos_prov` | **Advanced.** WiFi credentials handed to a sealed device over BLE, with no access point and no captive portal — for the cases the setup portal cannot serve. Ships the Python client that speaks the protocol, because Espressif's phone app does not: `espos_prov` uses protocomm as a transport only, so espOS's own WiFi state machine stays the one thing that owns the radio. Read the client's `srp6a.py` for the handshake, where ESP-IDF's own header comments are wrong. | [BLE provisioning](provisioning.md) |
| [`duty_cycle`](https://github.com/signalk-espOS/espOS/tree/main/components/espos_power/examples/duty_cycle) | `espos_power` | **Advanced.** A device on a battery: wake, publish two readings, flush the stream, deep-sleep, again. The code is a few lines; read it for the rules that keep a mostly-sleeping device reachable — off until you turn it on, an awake window after every power-on or update, and no sleep while an update is unconfirmed, because every wake is a boot and would roll it back. | [Power](power.md) |

The reference application in `main/` at the repository root is not an
example but the app espOS's own CI builds on every target; it exercises every
descriptor type and every optional component, which is why it is larger than
any example.

## Where to go from an example

* Something in the runtime behaves unexpectedly: [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).
* The example does nearly what you want: the [tutorials](tutorials/first-sensor.md)
  walk from an example to a device of your own, one addition at a time.
* You have a SensESP project: [Migrating from SensESP](migration-from-sensesp.md)
  maps its concepts onto these examples.
