# Network (`espos_net`)

The one place espOS answers "is the network up, and how". Every transport —
the WiFi station and wired Ethernet today, 802.15.4 next — reports its link into
`espos_net`; SignalK, OTA, mDNS and the health policy ask `espos_net`, never
a radio. Configuration is the `net` namespace (`hostname`); status is
`GET /api/v1/net/status` and the `net` SSE event.

## Why a seam

Until 0.7 `espos_sk`, `espos_ota` and the mDNS responder called
`espos_wifi_get_status()` to learn whether they had a network, took the
device id from the station's MAC and the hostname from `wifi.hostname`. That
tied three components that know nothing about radios to one particular
radio: an Ethernet gateway, a firmware on the 802.15.4-only H-series, or a
headless build without WiFi would have had to carry `espos_wifi` along just
to satisfy those calls. The seam is small — link up or down, the addresses,
an id, a name — so it became one component that every transport feeds and
everything else consumes.

## The contract (`espos_net.h`)

```c
typedef struct {
    bool up;  espos_net_if_t iface;                     /* the interface carrying the default route */
    char ip[16], netmask[16], gateway[16], ip6_ll[40];
    uint8_t mac[6]; char hostname[33]; int8_t rssi;     /* rssi 0 unless the route is the WiFi station */
    uint32_t up_count, up_since_ms;                     /* how often the route came up; ms it has been up (0 when down) */
} espos_net_status_t;

esp_err_t   espos_net_start(void);                      /* after espos_httpd_start(); owns hostname + mDNS */
esp_err_t   espos_net_get_status(espos_net_status_t *out);   /* never calls a driver */
bool        espos_net_is_up(void);
esp_err_t   espos_net_subscribe(espos_net_cb_t cb, void *arg);   /* up / down / route moved */
const char *espos_net_short_id(void);                   /* "1a2b": last two bytes of the base MAC */
uint32_t    espos_net_backoff_ms(uint32_t round, uint32_t cap_ms, uint32_t rnd);
/* transports report in: */
esp_err_t   espos_net_register_if(espos_net_if_t iface, void *esp_netif);
void        espos_net_report(espos_net_if_t iface, bool up, const char *ip, const char *netmask, const char *gateway, int8_t rssi);
```

`espos_net_if_t` is `ESPOS_NET_IF_WIFI_STA`, `ESPOS_NET_IF_ETH` or
`ESPOS_NET_IF_THREAD` (`ESPOS_NET_IF_NONE` when down). `mac` is the base MAC
from eFuse; `ip6_ll` the link-local IPv6 address of the interface carrying
the route, empty when there is none or the build has no IPv6.

`espos_net_get_status()` and `espos_net_is_up()` **never call a driver**:
a status snapshot must not depend on a radio answering. On the ESP32-P4 the
radio is a co-processor behind an RPC that stalls when the link wedges, and
a status label on a display task once froze the whole UI that way
([wifi.md](wifi.md), "Co-processor link watchdog"). The netif the addresses
come from is host-side lwIP on every target, the P4 included.

## Default-route rule

One interface carries the default route at a time. When several are up the
preference is static — **Ethernet over WiFi station over Thread** — with no
metric and no probing, so a consumer can predict the answer from this
sentence. A wired link is the one somebody ran a cable for; the station is
the fallback; a Thread border route is last because it is the slowest and
the least likely to reach a SignalK server directly.

Each `espos_net_report()` produces one of three edges, or none:

| Report | Edge | What consumers see |
|---|---|---|
| first interface up | `UP` | `ESPOS_EVENT_NETWORK_UP`, subscribers, `net` SSE |
| last interface down | `DOWN` | `ESPOS_EVENT_NETWORK_DOWN`, subscribers, `net` SSE |
| a preferred interface comes up, the preferred one goes away, or the route's own address changes | `CHANGED` | `NETWORK_DOWN` then `NETWORK_UP` — sockets bound to the old address are dead either way, so the "one DOWN per UP" rule holds and the SignalK stream re-dials |
| same data again, an RSSI refresh, a change on a standby interface | none | the `net` SSE event when anything in the status changed; no event, no callback |

`up_count` counts `UP` and `CHANGED` edges since boot; `up_since_ms` is the
time the current route has been up. The machine is pure C over an injected
clock (`espos_net_sm.h`, `src/net_sm.c`) and every row above is a case in
`test/host/espos_net_test`.

## Events, callbacks, threading

| Signal | When | Runs on |
|---|---|---|
| `ESPOS_EVENT_NETWORK_UP` / `_DOWN` | route edges, as in the table above; `NETWORK_UP` carries `espos_event_network_t {ip, hostname}` | the default event loop task |
| `espos_net_subscribe()` callback | every edge (not RSSI refreshes), with a copy of the status | the task of the transport that reported — for WiFi the default event loop task; no `espos_net` lock held; copy out and return, never block |
| `net` SSE event | every status change, RSSI refreshes included; a snapshot on connect | the reporting task, through `espos_httpd_sse_publish()` |
| `ESPOS_EVENT_MDNS_READY` | every `NETWORK_UP` once the responder runs | the default event loop task |

Events are notifications, not state: a late subscriber asks
`espos_net_get_status()` for the picture and uses the events for changes
from then on ([concepts.md](concepts.md), "Events").

## Hostname and device id

`net.hostname` (string, ≤ 32 characters, `[A-Za-z0-9-]`, restart required)
is the name the device answers to as `<hostname>.local`, sends in its DHCP
request, uses as the SignalK source label and shows in the server's
access-request list. Empty — the default — means `espos-<id>`.

The id is `espos_net_short_id()`: the last two bytes of the **base MAC**
read from eFuse (`esp_read_mac(ESP_MAC_BASE)`), so it is the same whether
the device speaks WiFi, Ethernet or Thread. Until 0.7 the WiFi station's MAC
was used, which on a native radio is the same number. On the ESP32-P4 it is
not: the station MAC belongs to the C6 co-processor, the base MAC to the P4
itself, so a P4 device without a configured hostname changes its default
name once on the upgrade (hostname, portal SSID, SignalK source label — the
server shows a new source). Set `net.hostname` to keep a name across it.

**Moved from `wifi.hostname`.** The key lived in the `wifi` namespace until
0.7. `espos_net_start()` moves a value found there into `net.hostname` once
(only if `net.hostname` is unset) and clears the old key; a value written to
`wifi.hostname` afterwards — by an old script — is moved the same way at the
next boot. The `wifi.hostname` descriptor stays for one release so the
store still knows the key; it is titled "moved" in the UI and reads back
empty once the device has booted on this version. Removed in 0.9.

## `GET /api/v1/net/status`

```json
{"up": true, "iface": "wifi_sta", "ip": "192.168.1.23", "netmask": "255.255.255.0", "gateway": "192.168.1.1",
 "ip6_ll": "fe80::3e71:bfff:fe12:1a2b", "mac": "3c:71:bf:12:1a:2b", "hostname": "espos-1a2b", "id": "1a2b",
 "rssi": -59, "up_count": 1, "up_s": 26}
```

`iface` ∈ `none wifi_sta eth thread`; `rssi` is `null` unless the route is
the WiFi station; `up_s` is seconds since the route came up (0 when down);
`ip6_ll` is `""` when there is none. The same document is pushed as the
`net` SSE event on connect and on every change. `GET /api/v1/wifi/status`
is unchanged and stays the place for WiFi-specific detail (state machine,
SSID, portal, reason codes).

## How a transport plugs in

`espos_wifi` is the template; an Ethernet driver does the same four things:

1. **Start after `espos_net_start()`.** It owns the hostname the DHCP request
   carries, so the order is enforced: `espos_wifi_start()` refuses to run
   before it (`ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE`, one log line). `espos_start()` does
   `httpd → net → [wifi] → [sk] → [ota] → [ble]`.
2. **Register the netif** once it exists:
   `espos_net_register_if(ESPOS_NET_IF_ETH, netif)`. `espos_net` sets the
   hostname on it and reads its link-local address for the status.
3. **Report every change:** `espos_net_report(ESPOS_NET_IF_ETH, true, ip,
   netmask, gateway, 0)` on `IP_EVENT_ETH_GOT_IP`, `espos_net_report(..., false,
   NULL, NULL, NULL, 0)` on link down or lost IP. Identical reports are
   no-ops, so reporting from every status change is fine. Report from your
   own task — `espos_net_report()` runs the subscribers on it before it
   returns — and never under a lock a subscriber might want.
4. **Post no `NETWORK_UP`/`NETWORK_DOWN` yourself.** `espos_net` decides
   whether the *default route* changed; a second link coming up while the
   first carries the route is not a network event to anyone above the seam.

The station reports from `espos_wifi`'s drainer, outside its state-machine
lock, so the events go out from inside the `IP_EVENT_STA_GOT_IP` handler and
both `espos_wifi_get_status()` and `espos_net_get_status()` already say
"up" when a `NETWORK_UP` handler runs. Static addressing is a WiFi setting
(`wifi.ip_mode` and friends, [wifi.md](wifi.md), "Addressing"): the netif
still raises `GOT_IP` with a static address, so `espos_net` sees no
difference.

## Wired Ethernet (`espos_eth`)

The second transport, and the checklist above applied: the chip's internal
EMAC and an RMII PHY with DHCP, the netif registered as `ESPOS_NET_IF_ETH`,
`IP_EVENT_ETH_GOT_IP` reported up and link loss or `IP_EVENT_ETH_LOST_IP`
reported down. It starts beside the WiFi station, not instead of it, and the
static preference above puts the route on the cable whenever it has a link.

There is little to configure. The EMAC's pins are IDF's
`ETH_ESP32_EMAC_DEFAULT_CONFIG`, which on the ESP32-P4 is exactly the Waveshare
ESP32-P4-WIFI6-POE-ETH wiring (MDC 31, MDIO 52, RMII clock in on GPIO 50). What
varies per board is under menu "espOS Ethernet":

| Kconfig | ESP32-P4 default | |
|---|---|---|
| `CONFIG_ESPOS_ETH_PHY_ADDR` | `1` | the PHY's MDIO address; `-1` scans |
| `CONFIG_ESPOS_ETH_PHY_RST_GPIO` | `51` | the PHY's active-low reset; `-1` for none |

The PHY is driven by IDF's generic IEEE 802.3 driver. IDF 6 moved the named
PHY drivers (IP101, LAN87xx, ...) to the component registry; the generic one
reads link, speed and duplex from the standard registers, which is all a
transport needs, and adds no dependency.

`espos_start()` starts it when the component is in the build and
`CONFIG_ESPOS_ETH` is on, and **does not fail if it cannot**: a PHY that does
not answer is logged and the device carries on, rather than turning
`ESP_ERROR_CHECK(espos_start())` into a reboot loop on a device that could
have come up on WiFi. An unplugged cable is not an error at all. A wrong PHY
address or reset GPIO fails the same quiet way, which is why the install error
names both settings.

mDNS follows the cable without help: the netif is IDF's default Ethernet netif
(`ETH_DEF`), which the responder picks up when `CONFIG_MDNS_PREDEF_NETIF_ETH`
is on, its default.

On a chip without an internal EMAC (ESP32-C3, C6, S3) the component compiles to
stubs: `espos_eth_start()` returns `ESP_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.

## mDNS

`espos_net` runs the device's mDNS responder (`espos_mdns.h`, `src/mdns.c`;
it moved here from `espos_wifi` with the API unchanged). It answers for
**`<hostname>.local`** — `net.hostname`, default `espos-<id>` — with that
name as the instance name, and advertises two services on `httpd.port`:

| Service        | TXT                                                                                    | For                                         |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `_http._tcp`   | `path=/`                                                                               | browsers, "open the device" in any mDNS app |
| `_espos._tcp`  | `v=<app version>` `app=<app name>` `espos=<espOS version>` `target=<chip>` `id=<short id>` `api=/api/v1` `auth=0` | finding every espOS device with one query and knowing what it is before fetching anything |

`v` and `app` are IDF's `PROJECT_VER` / `PROJECT_NAME` (the values
`esp_app_desc_t` carries, `git describe` for the version in a tagged
checkout), compiled in by the component's `CMakeLists.txt`; `espos` is
espOS's own `version.txt` (the manifest version in a registry-installed
copy). `id` is `espos_net_short_id()`. `auth=0` says the REST API takes no
credentials; it flips when it grows some.

`espos_net_start()` brings the responder up before any interface has an
address. That is deliberate: the responder accepts records without a link
and announces them itself on `GOT_IP`, and doing the work there rather than
in a `NETWORK_UP` handler keeps the event loop free (`mdns_hostname_set()`
waits for the responder task; `mdns_service_add()` takes a lock that task
holds while it parses packets — neither belongs in a handler). The link
state is tracked separately: **`ESPOS_EVENT_MDNS_READY`** is posted on every
`NETWORK_UP` once the responder runs, and `espos_mdns_is_ready()` answers
true exactly while a query or an announcement can reach the network (false
again on `NETWORK_DOWN`). SignalK discovery starts browsing on that signal.

### Registering a service

```c
#include "espos_mdns.h"

static const char *const txt[] = { "schema=1", "widgets=label,value,toggle", "api=/layout,/hello" };
ESP_ERROR_CHECK(espos_mdns_add_service("_signalk-player", "_tcp", 8081, txt, 3));
/* ... */
espos_mdns_remove_service("_signalk-player", "_tcp");
```

* Callable **any time**, from any application task or `app_main()` — before
  `espos_start()`, before the network, before the responder exists. The
  entry waits in a table of `CONFIG_ESPOS_NET_MDNS_MAX_SERVICES` (default 6)
  slots and is registered when the responder comes up; afterwards it is
  registered at once. There is no readiness to wait for and nothing to retry.
* Adding a `(type, proto)` that is already in the table replaces its port
  and TXT: the old record is withdrawn, the new one announced.
* Limits (refused, never truncated): type < 32 chars starting with `_`,
  proto `_tcp` or `_udp`, up to 8 TXT items totalling 256 bytes with their
  separators. `"k"` without `=` is a flag item (empty value).
* Returns `ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG` / `ESP_ERR_INVALID_SIZE` for a malformed
  request, `ESP_ERR_NO_MEM` when the table is full, and the responder's own
  error when it refuses the record (its ceiling is `CONFIG_MDNS_MAX_SERVICES`,
  default 10: the two built-ins, these slots and anything a component adds
  with `mdns_service_add()` directly all count) — then the entry is
  dropped, not queued. `ESP_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED` when built without the
  responder.
* Threading: `espos_mdns_start()`, `espos_mdns_add_service()` and
  `espos_mdns_remove_service()` run on the caller's task and may block for a
  few milliseconds on the responder — not from an `ESPOS_EVENT` handler or a
  URI handler. `espos_mdns_is_ready()` only takes the table mutex.

What this replaces in consumers: a 2-second retry loop around
`mdns_service_add()` that watched for `ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE` until espOS
happened to have started the responder (the P4 cockpit's
`mdns_announce.cpp`) becomes the one call above. `espos_n2k` keeps its own
`mdns_service_add()` in the candump server: that component deliberately has
no espOS dependencies, and the responder is the same one either way.

### Configuration

* `CONFIG_ESPOS_NET_MDNS` (default y) — the responder and the whole API.
  Off saves the responder task and its sockets (~4 KB) and makes the device
  reachable by address only; SignalK discovery cannot run without it and
  `sk.server_host` must be set. Not available on the linux target
  (`espressif/mdns` does not exist there), where `espos_mdns_*` compile to
  stubs returning `ESP_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED` / `false`. `CONFIG_ESPOS_WIFI_MDNS`,
  the 0.7 name, still exists as a derived read-only symbol so files that
  spell it keep meaning something; setting it does nothing.
* `CONFIG_ESPOS_NET_MDNS_MAX_SERVICES` (default 6, 1..16) — application
  service slots.
* `net.hostname` (restart required) — the `.local` name.

## Builds without WiFi

`espos_core` requires `espos_wifi` on every chip with a radio, or — the
ESP32-P4 — a co-processor; the 802.15.4-only H-series (esp32h2, esp32h21,
esp32h4) has neither, `esp_wifi` does not exist there and `espos_wifi`
cannot build. `espos_project_prologue()` excludes it on those targets and
records the decision as the `ESPOS_WIFI` build property, which
`espos_core`'s `CMakeLists.txt` reads in early expansion (before sdkconfig
exists, so a Kconfig symbol could not carry it); a project that bypasses the
prologue gets the same rule from the target name. Everything above the seam
builds and starts: `espos_start()` runs `httpd → net → [sk] → [ota]`, logs
that no transport is built, and the device has a network the moment some
transport reports one.

`CONFIG_ESPOS_WIFI` (espOS core, default y, offered on chips with WiFi) is
the runtime switch for a firmware that *links* `espos_wifi` but carries its
network elsewhere — an Ethernet gateway on a WiFi chip: off, `espos_start()`
skips `espos_wifi_start()` and the station, its portal and the `/wifi`
endpoints never come up; nothing else changes.

## Design notes

* Only `espos_net_report()` and `espos_net_register_if()` are for
  transports; everything else is for consumers. The header carries no IDF
  type (the netif is `void *`), so a binding generated from it does not drag
  `esp_netif.h` along.
* The WiFi wrappers `espos_wifi_short_id()` and `espos_wifi_backoff_ms()`
  stay for one release (removed in 0.9); the former returns
  `espos_net_short_id()`, the latter is the same curve kept standalone so
  the WiFi state machine still builds on its own in its host test.
  `espos_wifi_get_status()` is not deprecated — it is the WiFi-specific
  view — but it is no longer the answer to "is the network up".
* On the linux target the port has no netif and a fixed base MAC
  `02:00:00:00:1a:2b`, the address the simulated station always had, so the
  host device keeps its id `1a2b` and the REST harness its expectations.
