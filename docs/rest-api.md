# espOS REST API — v1

Base path: `/api/v1`. All request and response bodies are JSON
(`Content-Type: application/json`) unless stated otherwise. The UI (M5) is
developed against this document, so **changing anything here is a
cross-component decision** — raise it before editing.

Status of each endpoint: **M1** = implemented now; later milestones are listed
so the shape is agreed early and marked *planned*. Each endpoint is also marked
**public** or **protected** — whether [authentication](#authentication) applies
once an API key is set.

## Conventions

* Errors are always
  ```json
  {"error": "<machine_code>", "message": "<human text>"}
  ```
  with an appropriate 4xx/5xx status — including the server's own errors
  (`404 not_found`, `405 method_not_allowed`, `400 bad_request`, `408
  timeout`, `411 length_required`, `413 too_large`, `414 uri_too_long`, `431
  headers_too_large`, `500 internal`). Validation errors on `PUT /config`
  add a `path` (see below).
* While a reboot or factory reset is pending (≈500 ms) writes are refused
  with `503 restarting`.
* **State-changing requests (`PUT`, `POST`) must send `Content-Type:
  application/json`**, otherwise `415 unsupported_media_type`. This is the
  CSRF guard: a browser cannot send that header cross-origin without a CORS
  preflight, which the device never grants. `curl -X POST -H
  'Content-Type: application/json' …` for the system endpoints. A request
  authenticated by the login *cookie* must in addition come from the device's
  own origin (see Authentication).
* Responses that must not be cached carry `Cache-Control: no-store`.
* Secrets (descriptor `secret: true`) are never returned. They read back as
  the sentinel `"********"` when set and `""` when unset; writing the
  sentinel is a no-op, so an exported document can be imported unchanged.
* Blobs are base64 strings (RFC 4648, padded).
* **Authentication** is the section below. With `httpd.api_key` unset the
  API is open to anyone on the network (the default — treat it like the
  SensESP config UI); once a key is set, every endpoint marked *protected*
  needs `Authorization: Bearer <key>` or the login cookie, else `401`.

## Authentication

Everything is **protected** unless marked **public**. Protection is off until
`httpd.api_key` is set (so an update keeps an existing device open); from then
on a protected request must carry one of

* `Authorization: Bearer <key>` — machine clients: the designer, a fleet
  plugin, scripts. Stateless.
* the `espos_sid` cookie from `POST /auth/login` — browsers. `fetch()` and
  `EventSource` send it by themselves; `HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Path=/`.

or arrive on the device's own setup-portal network, which is exempt (the
lockout recovery, [security.md](security.md)). Otherwise:

| Status | `error` | When |
|---|---|---|
| `401` | `unauthorized` | no or invalid credential, a stale cookie included; carries `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="espOS"` |
| `403` | `forbidden` | a cookie-authenticated `PUT`/`POST`/`DELETE` whose `Origin` (else `Referer`) host is not the `Host`, or that has neither — Bearer requests skip this |
| `403` | `auth_unconfigured` | the build has `CONFIG_ESPOS_HTTPD_AUTH_REQUIRED=y` and no key is set yet; set one from the portal |
| `429` | `too_many_attempts` | five wrong keys within 60 s: every key check (login and Bearer, the right key too) answers this for 30 s, `Retry-After` says how long; live cookies keep working |

The check runs before the handler, for every endpoint registered through
`espos_httpd_register()` — an application's own included; an endpoint that
must stay open registers with `espos_httpd_register_ex(uri, ESPOS_HTTPD_PUBLIC)`.
Changing or clearing the key drops every session. Over plain http the key
crosses the network in clear, like the SignalK token does.

### `POST /auth/login` — public

Body `{"key": "<httpd.api_key>"}` (JSON content type required) → `204` with

```
Set-Cookie: espos_sid=<32 hex>; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Path=/; Max-Age=<httpd.session_ttl_s>
```

`401 unauthorized` for a wrong key (counted), `429` while throttled, `409
auth_open` when no key is configured, `400 validation` for a bad body.
Sessions live in RAM: `CONFIG_ESPOS_HTTPD_MAX_SESSIONS` (4) at a time — one
more evicts the session idle longest — and a reboot ends them all.

### `POST /auth/logout` — public

Drops the session the cookie names, if any → `204` with a cookie of
`Max-Age=0`. JSON content type required.

### `GET /auth/status` — public

```json
{"required": true, "configured": true, "authenticated": true, "method": "cookie"}
```

`required`: protected endpoints need a credential (a key is set, or the build
requires one); `configured`: a key is set; `authenticated`: *this* request
carried a valid one, or came from the portal; `method` ∈ `none bearer cookie
portal`. The web UI decides from this whether to show its login page. A wrong
Bearer on this endpoint counts toward the throttle like any other key check.

## Configuration

### `GET /config` — M1 · protected

Effective configuration (stored values, else compiled-in defaults), one
object per NVS namespace:

```json
{
  "app":   {"label": "espOS device", "enabled": true, "interval_ms": 1000, ...},
  "httpd": {"port": 80}
}
```

Query: `?ns=<namespace>` limits the response to that namespace
(`404 unknown_namespace` if it does not exist or is longer than a namespace
can be; `414 uri_too_long` for a query string ≥ 128 bytes).

### `PUT /config` — M1 · protected

Body: same shape as `GET`, **partial documents allowed**. Semantics:

| Value in body                    | Effect                                    |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| key present with a value         | validated, then written                   |
| key present with `null`          | reset to the compiled-in default          |
| key absent                       | untouched                                 |
| secret key set to `"********"`   | untouched                                 |
| unknown namespace or key         | `400`, nothing written                    |

The whole document is validated first; on any validation error **nothing is
written**. (A storage failure while applying an already-validated document
is reported as `500 write_failed`; keys before the failing one may have been
written.)

Success `200`:
```json
{"changed": ["app.interval_ms", "httpd.port"], "restart_required": true}
```
`changed` lists keys whose *effective* value changed (writing the current
value is not a change). `restart_required` is true if any changed key is
flagged `restart_required` in its descriptor.

Failure `400`:
```json
{"error": "validation", "path": "app.interval_ms", "message": "out of range [100,60000]"}
```
`path` is `"<ns>.<key>"`, `"<ns>"`, or `""` for document-level errors
(`"malformed JSON"`, `"expected object of namespaces"`).

Other statuses: `413 too_large` (body over `CONFIG_ESPOS_HTTPD_MAX_BODY`,
default 16 KiB), `408 timeout` (body did not arrive), `503 restarting`,
`500 write_failed`. Trailing non-whitespace after the JSON document is
`400 validation` (`"malformed JSON"`).

### `GET /config/schema` — M1 · protected

JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) of the whole configuration document, generated
at build time from the config descriptors. `Content-Type:
application/schema+json`. Sent with an `ETag`; a request with a matching
`If-None-Match` gets `304`. Vendor extensions used by the UI:

| Extension                   | On          | Meaning                                  |
|-----------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| `x-espos-version`           | namespace   | descriptor schema version                |
| `x-espos-secret: true`      | key         | write-only secret (also `writeOnly`, `format: password`) |
| `x-espos-restartRequired`   | key         | takes effect after reboot                |
| `x-espos-unit`              | key         | display unit                             |
| `x-espos-type: "blob"`      | key         | base64 bytes; `x-espos-maxBytes` is the decoded limit |

## System

### `GET /system/ping` — public

```json
{"app": "espos", "version": "0.7.0-3-gabc1234", "auth": true}
```
Liveness for a fleet page or a discovery tool: which firmware, and whether it
wants a key (`auth` is `/auth/status`'s `required`). Nothing mDNS does not
already advertise.

### `GET /system/info` — M1 · protected

```json
{
  "app": "espos", "version": "0.1.0-3-gabc1234", "idf_version": "v6.0.2",
  "chip": "esp32c6", "chip_revision": 1, "cores": 1,
  "uptime_s": 42, "free_heap": 210000, "min_free_heap": 190000,
  "reset_reason": "software", "config_storage_reset": false,
  "schema_etag": "6acfba355e183b19", "ui_storage": true,
  "hardware": {
    "mac": "60:55:f9:00:1a:2b", "cpu_mhz": 160, "flash_bytes": 8388608,
    "ram_internal_bytes": 524288, "ram_psram_bytes": 0,
    "features": ["wifi", "ble", "802.15.4", "embedded-flash"],
    "board": "Espressif ESP32-C6-DevKitC-1"
  },
  "time": {"synced": true, "source": "sntp", "now": 1788775933456},
  "last_reset": {
    "reason": "software", "health_key": "skLinkStalled",
    "message": "stream down for over 300 s while WiFi reports connected",
    "min_free_heap_before": 148216, "min_internal_before": 31720,
    "largest_block_before": 25600, "uptime_before_s": 86742,
    "at": "2026-09-07T04:12:31Z"
  }
}
```

`hardware` answers "which board is this", which matters once there is more than
one on the bench. Most of it is read from the chip; `cpu_mhz` is what the build
asked for and `board` is what the firmware declared, so neither is a live
measurement:

| field | |
|---|---|
| `mac` | the base MAC — the identity `espos_net` derives the short id and default hostname from |
| `cpu_mhz` | what the build asked for (`CONFIG_ESP_DEFAULT_CPU_FREQ_MHZ`), not a live reading |
| `flash_bytes` | the flash chip's size |
| `ram_internal_bytes`, `ram_psram_bytes` | **totals**, not free — `free_heap` above is the live number. `ram_psram_bytes: 0` means no PSRAM, which is what separates two boards with the same chip. |
| `features` | `wifi`, `ble`, `bt-classic`, `802.15.4`, `embedded-flash`, `embedded-psram`, from `esp_chip_info()`'s bitmask |
| `board` | **only if the firmware said so** (`espos_start_opts_t.board`); absent otherwise |

`board` cannot be discovered: ESP-IDF knows the chip, not what it is soldered
to, the MAC's OUI is Espressif's rather than the board vendor's, and the
`USER_DATA` efuse a vendor could burn an identifier into is blank on every
board seen here. The firmware is the only thing that knows, and it usually
already does — a Kconfig `choice` selecting the board has a prompt string that
is exactly this. Pass it to `espos_start()`:

```c
espos_start(&(espos_start_opts_t){
    .app_name = "cockpit",
    .board    = "Waveshare ESP32-P4-WIFI6-Touch-LCD-7B",
});
```

Deliberately absent: display size and touch (espOS has no display concept — a
firmware with a panel knows its own geometry), and radio *versions* like
"BLE 5.0" or "WiFi 6" — the feature bits say whether, not which, and a version
would be a hardcoded datasheet table espOS cannot verify.

The whole object is absent on a device built before it existed, so a client
should treat it and every member as optional.
`ui_storage` (M5) is true when the LittleFS UI partition is mounted.
`config_storage_reset` is true when the NVS partition had to be erased at
boot (corrupt/incompatible) and every value is a default.
`reset_reason` ∈ `poweron external software panic int_wdt task_wdt wdt
deepsleep brownout sdio usb jtag efuse power_glitch cpu_lockup unknown`.

`time` is the short form of `GET /time` below and is always present: `synced`,
`source` ∈ `none rtc sk manual sntp`, and `now` in unix milliseconds (`0` when
the device has not been told the time). A firmware built without `espos_time`
reports `{"synced": false, "source": "none", "now": 0}` — the honest answer,
so a client never has to guess whether the component is there.

`last_reset` is the record the health watchdog ([health.md](health.md)) left
when it restarted the device: `reason` (the reset reason, `software` for a
watchdog restart), `health_key` and `message` of the condition that struck
out, the low-water marks of total heap (`min_free_heap_before`) and internal
RAM (`min_internal_before`), the largest free internal block at the time
(`largest_block_before`), how long that boot had run (`uptime_before_s`) and
the wall-clock time (`at`, ISO 8601 UTC; `null` when the clock was never set).
`null` when the last reset was not the watchdog's — power-on, a panic (see
`/system/coredump`), an OTA reboot, `POST /system/reboot`. It stays for the
whole boot and is gone after the next reset, whatever its cause.

### `POST /system/reboot` — M1 · protected

`202 {"status": "rebooting"}` — the device restarts ~500 ms after
responding.

### `GET /system/coredump` — M5 · protected

Summary of the core dump saved by the last panic, `404 not_found` when
there is none:

```json
{"present": true, "size": 18848, "valid": true, "task": "httpd", "pc": "0x4003530c",
 "app_elf_sha256": "adef2c527", "version": 1179908,
 "mcause": 7, "mtval": "0x00000010", "ra": "0x40035308", "sp": "0x4ff45580", "stackdump_bytes": 448}
```
RISC-V targets carry `mcause/mtval/ra/sp/stackdump_bytes`; Xtensa targets
`exc_cause`, `exc_vaddr`, `backtrace` (array of PCs) and
`backtrace_corrupted`. `app_elf_sha256` identifies the build that crashed
(compare with `idf.py` output / `esp_app_desc`).

`GET /system/coredump/raw` streams the image as `application/octet-stream`
for `espcoredump.py --chip <target> info_corefile -c coredump.bin -t raw
build/espos.elf` (needs the ELF of exactly that build). `DELETE
/system/coredump` erases it (`{"status": "erased"}`).

`POST /system/crash` (only with `CONFIG_ESPOS_HTTPD_DEBUG_CRASH=y`, off by
default) panics on purpose to test the path.

### `POST /system/factory-reset` — M1 · protected

Arms the reboot (further writes get `503`), erases the whole NVS partition,
responds `202 {"status": "factory_reset", "rebooting": true}`, then reboots.
WiFi credentials and the SignalK token live in NVS too, so this returns the
device to provisioning.

## Logs — M5

### `GET /logs` · protected

The in-RAM log ring (`CONFIG_ESPOS_LOG_RING_SIZE`, 16 KiB), paged by
sequence number: `?after=<seq>` returns lines with a higher sequence
(default: from the oldest kept), `?limit=<n>` (default 200, max 1000).

```json
{"first": 1, "next": 101, "dropped": 0, "size": 16384, "used": 5911, "gap": false, "from": 1,
 "lines": ["I (500) espos_config: ready: 4 namespace(s), schema 8851b3f24a88fe45", "…"]}
```
`lines[i]` has sequence `from + i`; poll on with `after = next - 1`.
`gap` is true when `after` was older than the ring still holds (lines were
overwritten in between); `first`/`dropped` say how many. Lines are the
console lines without colour codes, truncated at
`CONFIG_ESPOS_LOG_LINE_MAX` (256). Streamed in chunks, so a full ring never
has to fit in RAM twice.

### `PUT /logs/level` · protected

`{"level": "debug", "tag": "espos_sk"}` (`tag` optional, default `*`;
`level` ∈ `none error warn info debug verbose`) → `200 {"tag","level"}`;
`400 validation` otherwise. Runtime only (`esp_log_level_set`), not
persisted.

## Static UI — M5 — public

Everything that is not `/api/…` is served from the LittleFS `storage`
partition (the gzipped Vite bundle, see [ui.md](ui.md)): `<path>.gz` is
preferred and sent with `Content-Encoding: gzip` (`curl --compressed`),
`/assets/*` (content-hashed) with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000,
immutable`, everything else `no-cache`. An extension-less path that does
not exist falls back to `/index.html` (SPA routes such as `/wifi`); a
missing file with an extension is `404 {"error": "not_found"}`, as is
anything unknown under `/api/`. When the partition has no `index.html` the
placeholder page embedded in the firmware is served instead
(`ui_storage: false` in `/system/info`).


## Network

### `GET /net/status`

The transport-neutral view of the network ([net.md](net.md)): whether a
default route exists, on which interface, with which addresses, and the
device's identity on it.

```json
{"up": true, "iface": "wifi_sta", "ip": "192.168.1.23", "netmask": "255.255.255.0", "gateway": "192.168.1.1",
 "ip6_ll": "fe80::3e71:bfff:fe12:1a2b", "mac": "3c:71:bf:12:1a:2b", "hostname": "espos-1a2b", "id": "1a2b",
 "rssi": -59, "up_count": 1, "up_s": 26}
```

`iface` ∈ `none wifi_sta eth thread` (`none` while down, with the address
strings empty); `mac` is the base MAC and `id` its last two bytes, the
device id every default name derives from; `rssi` is `null` unless the
route is the WiFi station; `up_count` counts how often the route came up or
moved since boot; `up_s` is seconds since it came up (0 when down); `ip6_ll`
is `""` when the interface has no link-local IPv6 address. `/wifi/status`
below is unchanged and keeps the WiFi-specific detail.

## Time

### `GET /time` — protected

What the device believes the time is and where it learned it ([time.md](time.md)).

```json
{"synced": true, "source": "sntp", "now": 1788775933456,
 "iso": "2026-09-07T10:12:13.456Z", "tz": "UTC0",
 "sntp": {"enabled": true, "running": true, "from_dhcp": true,
          "servers": ["pool.ntp.org"]}}
```

`source` ∈ `none rtc sk manual sntp`, ranked in that order: a lower-ranked
source never overrides a higher one, so nothing walks the clock back once NTP
has answered. `now` is unix milliseconds and `iso` the same instant as ISO 8601
UTC; both are `0` and `""` when nothing has set the clock — never a
plausible-looking 1970, so a missing time reads as missing.

`synced` is false either when no source has spoken or when the only one that
did was an RTC value carried through a deep sleep that has since gone stale
(`CONFIG_ESPOS_TIME_RTC_STALE_H`); in the stale case `now` is still the
device's best guess and `source` still says `rtc`.

`sntp.running` is true once polling started, which happens on the first
`NETWORK_UP` rather than at boot. `sntp.servers` lists the configured ones; a
server supplied by DHCP is not among them.

### `PUT /time` — protected

```json
{"now": 1788775933456}
```

Sets the clock as `source: "manual"`, and replies with the `GET /time`
document. `tz` may be sent instead of or alongside `now` to set the POSIX
timezone (`time.tz`) — a display concern only; nothing espOS publishes is ever
in local time.

`409 outranked` when a higher-ranked source already has the clock — in
practice, when SNTP has synced. `400 validation` when `now` is not a positive
unix-millisecond value or `tz` is too long.

## WiFi

### `GET /wifi/status` — M2 · protected

The status document described in [wifi.md](wifi.md): `state` ∈
`disabled unconfigured connecting obtaining_ip connected backoff`,
`reason: {code, text}`, link/IP details, `backoff_ms` while backing off,
counters, `portal: {active, ssid, ip?, clients?}`.

### `POST /wifi/scan` — M2 · protected

Starts an asynchronous scan. `202 {"status": "scanning"}`; `409 busy` if
the driver cannot scan right now. Requires the JSON content type.

### `GET /wifi/scan` — M2 · protected

```json
{"scanning": false, "age_s": 3,
 "results": [{"ssid": "Boat", "bssid": "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff", "rssi": -52, "channel": 6, "auth": "wpa2/wpa3"}]}
```
`age_s` is `null` before the first scan. `auth` ∈ `open wep wpa wpa2
wpa/wpa2 wpa2-enterprise wpa3 wpa2/wpa3 wapi owe other`. Results are cached;
a `wifi_scan` SSE event carries the same document when a scan finishes.

### Captive-portal probes — M2 — public on the portal network

`/generate_204`, `/gen_204`, `/hotspot-detect.html`,
`/library/test/success.html`, `/connecttest.txt`, `/ncsi.txt`, `/redirect`,
`/canonical.html`, `/success.txt` answer `302 → http://192.168.4.1/`. They
only matter to a phone that just joined the portal, and that network is
exempt from authentication; on the station side they are ordinary protected
endpoints.

## BLE provisioning

### `GET /prov` — protected

Present only when the build has `espos_prov` ([provisioning.md](provisioning.md)).

```json
{"active": true, "got_credentials": false,
 "service_name": "ESPOS_ca6a", "pop": "7K4M9QRT2WXY",
 "scheme": "espos-ble-prov-1"}
```

`pop` is the proof of possession a phone must present, served here because a
device-generated one is useless if nobody can read it. Reachable only over
the network, which a device being provisioned does not have yet — it is for
a device already on WiFi advertising for re-provisioning, and for the setup
portal, which serves it over its own access point.

## Events

### `GET /events` — M2 · protected

`text/event-stream` (chunked, `retry: 3000` first, a `: ping` comment every
15 s). Protected like the rest: a browser's `EventSource` sends the login
cookie by itself, a script sends the Bearer header. Events:

| event       | data                                | when                                   |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `net`       | the `/net/status` document           | on connect (snapshot) and every change: route up/down/moved, RSSI refresh |
| `wifi`      | the `/wifi/status` document          | on connect (snapshot) and every change |
| `wifi_scan` | the `/wifi/scan` document            | scan finished                          |
| `config`    | `{"ns": "...", "key": "..."}`         | a key's effective value changed        |

| `sk`        | the `/sk/status` document            | on connect and every token/server change |
| `sk_servers`| the `/sk/servers` document           | on connect and after each discovery pass |
| `sk_ws`     | the `ws` object of `/sk/status`      | stream connect/disconnect, error, drops |
| `sk_tls`    | the `/sk/tls` document               | on connect and whenever the pinned certificate changes |
| `logs`      | `{"next": <seq>}`                     | at most every 500 ms when new log lines arrived; fetch `/logs?after=` |
| `ota`       | the `/ota/status` document           | on connect, state changes, every ~32 KiB of download |
| `ble`       | the `/ble/status` document           | on connect (snapshot)                  |

At most `CONFIG_ESPOS_HTTPD_SSE_MAX_CLIENTS` (3) streams; when full the
oldest stream is evicted (clients reconnect via `retry`).

The "on connect" snapshots in the table above are one registered callback per
publishing component, capped by `CONFIG_ESPOS_HTTPD_SSE_MAX_CONNECT_CBS` (8).
A firmware that adds its own publishers registers after espOS's, so it is the
consumer's events that go missing if the cap is too low -- and the symptom is
quiet, because the endpoint still answers and later changes are still
published; only the snapshot a fresh client gets is absent. Registering past
the cap is refused with `ESP_ERR_NO_MEM` and logged by `espos_sse`.

## SignalK

`token.state` ∈ `no_server requesting pending verifying approved denied
open error cert_error`; `pending_href`/`pending_s` while pending;
`server.source` ∈ `discovered manual pinned none`; `server.scheme` ∈ `http
https` — what is actually in use, which under `sk.scheme = auto` is the only
place to read it. The token itself is never returned.

`cert_error` means the server's TLS certificate is not the one this device
trusts. The token is kept (it is the transport that is wrong, not the
credential), the retry is a flat 60 s rather than the exponential backoff an
unreachable server gets, and the stream stays down. `GET /sk/tls` says what
differed; `DELETE /sk/tls` accepts the new certificate. See
[SignalK → TLS](signalk.md#tls-https-wss).

`ws` (M4) is the delta stream: `pending` = values in the open batching
window, `buffered`/`buffered_bytes` = messages held in the offline ring,
`dropped` = messages the ring had to discard (oldest first),
`next_retry_s` while disconnected, `meta` = declared / reconciled counts.
`in` (M7): active subscriptions, text frames read, value/meta items
delivered; `put` (M7): requests in flight, answered OK, failed/timed out.

### `GET /sk/servers` — M3 · protected

`{"servers": [{"host","port","self","name","roles","swname","swvers","scheme","seen_s","selected"}], "last_s": 12}`

`scheme` is `https` for a server that advertised itself as
`_signalk-https._tcp` rather than `_signalk-http._tcp`, which is how
signalk-server says its `ssl` setting is on.

### `GET /sk/tls` — S1 · protected

Present only in a build with `CONFIG_ESPOS_SK_TLS` (the default).

```json
{
  "trust": "tofu",
  "pinned": {"kind": "leaf", "cn": "boat.local", "san": "192.168.1.10,boat.local",
             "fingerprint": "9f2c…", "since": 1789000000},
  "last_error": "",
  "presented": {"cn": "boat.local", "fingerprint": "9f2c…"}
}
```

`trust` ∈ `tofu ca bundle` (the `sk.tls_trust` setting). `pinned` is `null`
until something is anchored; `kind` ∈ `ca leaf` — `ca` binds the issuing CA
*and* the `san` set, so a renewal by the same CA for the same names is
accepted, while `leaf` is the certificate itself and a renewal needs a
`DELETE`. `fingerprint` is the SHA-256 of whichever certificate is anchored,
hex. `since` is unix seconds, `0` when the device had no clock at the time.
`presented` is what the last handshake showed (`null` before the first), and
`last_error` says how it differed — the pair is what makes a `cert_error`
actionable.

### `DELETE /sk/tls` — S1 · protected

Forget the anchor and retry at once: the deliberate "yes, that certificate
really was replaced" a pinned device needs after a renewal it could not follow
on its own. `202 {"status":"reset"}`.

### `PUT /sk/tls/ca` — S1 · protected

Body `{"pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----…"}` → `200
{"status":"stored","trust":"ca"}`. Validates the PEM before storing it (`400
validation` for anything that is not a certificate, or one over
`CONFIG_ESPOS_SK_TLS_CA_MAX`), writes it to `sk.ca_pem` and switches
`sk.tls_trust` to `ca`. Equivalent to setting both config keys, with the
parse check.

### `POST /sk/discover`, `POST /sk/request`, `POST /sk/forget` — M3 · protected

`202` with a status word; JSON content type required. `request` re-requests
access (from `denied`/`error`/`open`); `forget` drops the token (a pending
request keeps being polled).

### `POST /sk/token` — M3 · protected

Body `{"token": "<jwt>"}` → `202 {"status": "verifying"}`; the token is
verified against `/signalk/v1/api/self` and kept if it works. `400
validation` for a bad body.

### `POST /sk/publish` — M4 · protected

Publish a value for a `vessels.self` path — the C publish API over HTTP,
for scripts and the setup page:

```json
{"path": "espos.demo.count", "value": 42,
 "meta": {"units": "1", "description": "demo"}, "period_ms": 1000}
```
`meta`/`period_ms` are optional and go through `espos_sk_declare_meta()`
(same rules: non-standard paths only, `period_ms` adds `timeout`). `202
{"status":"queued"}`; `400 validation` for a bad body or an over-long
path/value; `503 not_ready` before the SignalK component is up. Queued
does not mean delivered: the value goes into the current batching window
and, if the stream is down, into the offline ring (see `ws` in
`/sk/status`).

### `POST /sk/put`, `GET /sk/put` — M7 · protected

`{"path": "navigation.anchor.maxRadius", "value": 30}` → `202
{"status":"sent"}` (`503 not_connected` without a stream, `429 busy` with
8 in flight, `400 validation`). The server answers asynchronously; `GET
/sk/put` returns the last answer `{"request_id","state","status_code",
"message"}` or `null`.

SSE events: `sk` (the status document, on connect and on change),
`sk_servers` (the servers document after each discovery pass), `sk_ws`
(the `ws` object on every stream state change), `sk_tls` (the `/sk/tls`
document when the pinned certificate changes).

## OTA — M6

### `GET /ota/status` · protected

```json
{"state": "idle", "last_error": "",
 "running": {"version": "0.6.1", "project": "espos", "target": "esp32p4", "slot": "ota_1",
             "image_state": "valid", "pending_verify": false, "confirmed": true,
             "other_slot": "ota_0", "other_version": "0.6.0", "rolled_back": false,
             "built": "Aug 18 2026 14:20:25", "idf": "v6.0.2"},
 "manifest": {"url": "http://…/manifest.json", "channel": "stable", "auto_check": true,
              "auto_install": false, "last_check_s": 120, "next_check_s": 86280},
 "progress": {"received": 0, "total": 0},
 "available": {"version": "0.6.2", "url": "http://…/espos-esp32p4-0.6.2.bin", "size": 0,
               "sha256": "", "notes": "…", "newer": true}}
```
`manifest.url` is what the last check actually fetched, which is not always
what is configured: with `ota.manifest_src = "signalk"` the URL is derived
from the connected server, and reporting the (empty) configured value would
tell an operator the device looks nowhere. Before the first check it falls
back to the configured `manifest_url`.

`state` ∈ `idle checking available downloading verifying ready failed`
(`ready` = installed, rebooting in ~1.5 s). `image_state` ∈ `valid
pending_verify new invalid aborted undefined`; `pending_verify` is true
while a fresh image has not confirmed itself; `rolled_back` when the other
slot holds an image that failed. `available` is `null` until a manifest
check found something. `last_check_s`/`next_check_s` are `null` before the
first check / when auto-check is off.

### `POST /ota/check`, `POST /ota`, `POST /ota/confirm`, `POST /ota/rollback` · protected

JSON content type required; `202 {"status": …}`. `POST /ota` with
`{"url": "http(s)://…"}` installs that image, with `{}` the *available*
build (`404 not_found` if none). `409 busy` while a check or install is
running; `400 validation` for a non-http(s) URL. Progress and the outcome
arrive via `GET /ota/status` and the `ota` SSE event.

## BLE gateway

Present only when `espos_ble` is in the build and Bluetooth is enabled in
sdkconfig. The component bridges BLE devices to signalk-server's BLE provider
API; it decodes nothing itself, so there is no device or sensor model here —
what a device *is* remains a server-side concern.

### `GET /ble/status` · protected

```json
{
  "enabled": true, "scanning": true, "mac": "D8:85:AC:FA:2C:46",
  "scan_hits": 2766, "adv_received": 2766, "adv_posted": 1840,
  "adv_dropped": 0, "adv_pending": 126,
  "post_success": 46, "post_fail": 0,
  "ws_connected": true,
  "gatt_sessions": 0, "gatt_max": 3
}
```

* `scan_hits` counts advertisements seen by the radio, `adv_received` those
  handed to the gateway; a gap between them means the intake callback is being
  starved.
* `adv_pending` is the ring buffer's depth and `adv_dropped` the running total
  shed once it is full (oldest first). Sustained growth in `adv_dropped` means
  the POST interval or the buffer is too small for the local radio traffic —
  it is a real count, not an estimate.
* `post_fail` counts POSTs the server refused or that never completed; a 401
  or 403 is reported to `espos_sk`, which owns the token, rather than
  triggering a second access request from here.
* `gatt_max` is the concurrent-session ceiling (3, Bluedroid's own limit) and
  is what the gateway advertises to the server in its `hello`.

There is no `POST /ble/...`: scanning is driven by config
(`PUT /config` with the `ble` namespace) and GATT sessions are opened by the
server over the control WebSocket, never through this API.

## Data flow

Present only when the firmware builds `espos_flow` and calls
`espos::flow::api_register(&graph)` (or `nullptr` for the counters alone).

### `GET /flow` · protected

```json
{
  "running": true,
  "loop": { "posts": 1842, "dropped": 0, "timers_fired": 3680,
            "timers_live": 2, "queue_peak": 3,
            "edges_used": 4, "edges_max": 96 },
  "nodes": [ { "id": "light" }, { "id": "cal", "title": "Calibration" },
             { "id": "sk" } ]
}
```

Replaces SensESP's status page, which was assembled from `StatusPageItem`
objects a firmware registered by hand: the graph already knows its own shape,
so a node added to it appears here without being told to.

`nodes` is in adoption order — the order `make<T>()` was called, which is the
order the firmware's own source reads in. It is `null`, not `[]`, when no
graph was registered: a firmware may drive the loop from C alone, and an
empty array would mean a graph that adopted nothing, which is a wiring bug.

The `loop` half is what matters in service and neither value raises an alarm
on its own:

* **`dropped`** climbing means something posts faster than the loop consumes.
  The value is lost, not queued.
* **`edges_used`** approaching `edges_max` means the next `connect_to()` will
  fail. The pool is static (`CONFIG_ESPOS_FLOW_MAX_EDGES`).
* **`queue_peak`** is the high-water mark, so it answers "how close did this
  ever come" rather than "how deep is it now".

## Planned (shape reserved, not implemented)

Nothing — M1–M7 and the authentication are implemented. Future additions go
here first.
